<!-- OPENSPEC:START -->
**Guardrails**
- Favor straightforward, minimal implementations first and add complexity only when it is requested or clearly required.
- Keep changes tightly scoped to the requested outcome.
- Refer to `openspec/AGENTS.md` (located inside the `openspec/` directory—run `ls openspec` or `openspec update` if you don't see it) if you need additional OpenSpec conventions or clarifications.

**Steps**
1. Read `changes/<id>/proposal.md`, `design.md` (if present), and `tasks.md` to confirm scope and acceptance criteria.
2. Use 'task-implementation-lifecycle' skill to implement the tasks.
3. Reference `openspec list` or `openspec show <item>` when additional context is required.

**Reference**
- Use `openspec show <id> --json --deltas-only` if you need additional context from the proposal while implementing.
