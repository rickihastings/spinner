# OpenSpec Instructions

Instructions for AI coding assistants using OpenSpec for spec-driven development.

## TL;DR Quick Checklist

- Search existing work: `openspec spec list --long`, `openspec list` (use `rg` only for full-text search)
- Decide scope: new capability vs modify existing capability
- Pick a unique `change-id`: kebab-case, verb-led (`add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`)
- Scaffold: `proposal.md`, `tasks.md`, `design.md` (only if needed), and delta specs per affected capability
- Write deltas: use `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED|RENAMED Requirements`; include at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement
- Validate: `openspec validate [change-id] --strict --no-interactive` and fix issues
- Request approval: Do not start implementation until proposal is approved

## Three-Stage Workflow

### Stage 1: Creating Changes
Create proposal when you need to:
- Add features or functionality
- Make breaking changes (API, schema)
- Change architecture or patterns  
- Optimize performance (changes behavior)
- Update security patterns

Triggers (examples):
- "Help me create a change proposal"
- "Help me plan a change"
- "Help me create a proposal"
- "I want to create a spec proposal"
- "I want to create a spec"

Loose matching guidance:
- Contains one of: `proposal`, `change`, `spec`
- With one of: `create`, `plan`, `make`, `start`, `help`

Skip proposal for:
- Bug fixes (restore intended behavior)
- Typos, formatting, comments
- Dependency updates (non-breaking)
- Configuration changes
- Tests for existing behavior

**Workflow**
1. Review `openspec/project.md`, `openspec list`, and `openspec list --specs` to understand current context.
2. Choose a unique verb-led `change-id` and scaffold `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and spec deltas under `openspec/changes/<id>/`.
3. Draft spec deltas using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement.
4. Run `openspec validate <id> --strict --no-interactive` and resolve any issues before sharing the proposal.

### Stage 2: Implementing Changes

**CRITICAL: One Vertical Slice Only**

Each agent invocation implements ONE complete feature (X.0). Do NOT scatter changes across the codebase or defer tests. The vertical slice must be fully implemented, tested, and committed—then the agent's job is done.

**Per-Task Cycle:**
1. **Select** - Pick first incomplete task from the vertical slice
2. **Investigate** - Search codebase for existing patterns before coding
3. **Implement** - Make minimal, focused changes following existing patterns
4. **Verify** - Run builds and tests; fix any failures before proceeding
5. **Update** - Mark task complete in `tasks.md` (`- [x]`)
6. **Commit** - Create meaningful commit, push changes
7. **Repeat** - Continue until all sub-tasks (X.1, X.2, X.3...) in the slice are done

**Rules:**
- Complete the entire vertical slice (all sub-tasks) in one agent session
- Each commit should leave the codebase in a valid, tested state
- Never defer tests—they are part of the vertical slice, not a separate phase
- If implementation diverges from spec, update the spec immediately
- On completion, signal `~~ FEATURE_COMPLETED ~~` and halt

### Stage 3: Archiving Changes
After deployment, create separate PR to:
- Move `changes/[name]/` → `changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-[name]/`
- Update `specs/` if capabilities changed
- Use `openspec archive <change-id> --skip-specs --yes` for tooling-only changes (always pass the change ID explicitly)
- Run `openspec validate --strict --no-interactive` to confirm the archived change passes checks

## Before Any Task

**Context Checklist:**
- [ ] Read relevant specs in `specs/[capability]/spec.md`
- [ ] Check pending changes in `changes/` for conflicts
- [ ] Read `openspec/project.md` for conventions
- [ ] Run `openspec list` to see active changes
- [ ] Run `openspec list --specs` to see existing capabilities

**Before Creating Specs:**
- Always check if capability already exists
- Prefer modifying existing specs over creating duplicates
- Use `openspec show [spec]` to review current state
- If request is ambiguous, ask 1–2 clarifying questions before scaffolding

### Search Guidance
- Enumerate specs: `openspec spec list --long` (or `--json` for scripts)
- Enumerate changes: `openspec list` (or `openspec change list --json` - deprecated but available)
- Show details:
  - Spec: `openspec show <spec-id> --type spec` (use `--json` for filters)
  - Change: `openspec show <change-id> --json --deltas-only`
- Full-text search (use ripgrep): `rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" openspec/specs`

## Quick Start

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Essential commands
openspec list                  # List active changes
openspec list --specs          # List specifications
openspec show [item]           # Display change or spec
openspec validate [item]       # Validate changes or specs
openspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]   # Archive after deployment (add --yes for non-interactive runs)

# Project management
openspec init [path]           # Initialize OpenSpec
openspec update [path]         # Update instruction files

# Interactive mode
openspec show                  # Prompts for selection
openspec validate              # Bulk validation mode

# Debugging
openspec show [change] --json --deltas-only
openspec validate [change] --strict --no-interactive
```

### Command Flags

- `--json` - Machine-readable output
- `--type change|spec` - Disambiguate items
- `--strict` - Comprehensive validation
- `--no-interactive` - Disable prompts
- `--skip-specs` - Archive without spec updates
- `--yes`/`-y` - Skip confirmation prompts (non-interactive archive)

## Creating Change Proposals

### Decision Tree

```
New request?
├─ Bug fix restoring spec behavior? → Fix directly
├─ Typo/format/comment? → Fix directly  
├─ New feature/capability? → Create proposal
├─ Breaking change? → Create proposal
├─ Architecture change? → Create proposal
└─ Unclear? → Create proposal (safer)
```

### Proposal Structure

1. **Create directory:** `changes/[change-id]/` (kebab-case, verb-led, unique)

2. **Write proposal.md:**
```markdown
# Change: [Brief description of change]

## Why
[1-2 sentences on problem/opportunity]

## What Changes
- [Bullet list of changes]
- [Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**]

## Impact
- Affected specs: [list capabilities]
- Affected code: [key files/systems]
```

3. **Create spec deltas:** `specs/[capability]/spec.md`
```markdown
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL provide...

#### Scenario: Success case
- **WHEN** user performs action
- **THEN** expected result

## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Existing Feature
[Complete modified requirement]

## REMOVED Requirements
### Requirement: Old Feature
**Reason**: [Why removing]
**Migration**: [How to handle]
```
If multiple capabilities are affected, create multiple delta files under `changes/[change-id]/specs/<capability>/spec.md`—one per capability.

4. **Create tasks.md:**

Tasks MUST be organized as **vertical feature slices**, not horizontal layers. Each top-level task (X.0) represents a complete, testable, committable feature.

**Structure:**
- `X.0` = Complete feature (e.g., "Implement `--prune` command")
- `X.1-X.n` = Sub-tasks that together deliver the feature
- Each `X.0` MUST include: implementation + tests + docs + verification
- After completing `X.0`, the codebase should be in a valid, tested, documented state

**What belongs in a vertical slice:**
1. Implementation code
2. Tests for that feature
3. Documentation updates (help text, comments, README sections)
4. Verification that everything works

**Example:**
```markdown
## 1.0 Implement `--prune` command
- [ ] 1.1 Add `--prune` flag to CLI argument parser
- [ ] 1.2 Implement container pruning logic in utils
- [ ] 1.3 Update help text to document `--prune` behavior
- [ ] 1.4 Add tests for `--prune` functionality
- [ ] 1.5 Verify tests pass and feature works end-to-end

## 2.0 Implement container listing
- [ ] 2.1 Add `--list` flag to CLI
- [ ] 2.2 Implement listing logic with filtering
- [ ] 2.3 Update help text to document `--list` behavior
- [ ] 2.4 Add tests for listing behavior
- [ ] 2.5 Verify tests pass
```

**Anti-pattern (DO NOT do this):**
```markdown
## 1. CLI Changes        ← Horizontal slice, tests deferred
- [ ] 1.1 Add --prune flag
- [ ] 1.2 Add --list flag
## 2. Backend Logic
- [ ] 2.1 Implement pruning
- [ ] 2.2 Implement listing
## 3. Tests              ← Tests come last, no TDD
- [ ] 3.1 Test pruning
- [ ] 3.2 Test listing
```

**Why vertical slices:**
- Each feature is independently committable
- Aligns with Stage 2 workflow (verify → commit → next)
- Enables TDD workflow
- Reduces context switching between unrelated code areas
- Clear progress: "Feature 1 done" vs "CLI half-done, backend half-done"

5. **Create design.md:**
Every change MUST include a `design.md` with a Technical Implementation Plan. This provides implementing agents with guidance on how to approach the work.

`design.md` template:
```markdown
## Context
[Background, constraints, stakeholders]

## Goals / Non-Goals
- Goals: [...]
- Non-Goals: [...]

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Component Map
- `path/to/file.ts` - [what changes] (create|modify|delete)
- `path/to/other.ts` - [what changes]

### Approach
[High-level strategy for implementation - what order, what patterns]

### Patterns to Follow
- See `path/to/example.ts:45-60` for [pattern name]
- [Other patterns to reference]

### Key Decisions
- [Decision]: [rationale]
- [Decision]: [rationale]

## Risks / Trade-offs
- [Risk] → Mitigation

## Open Questions
- [...]
```

The Technical Implementation Plan section is critical for guiding agents during implementation. At minimum, include Component Map and Approach.

## Spec File Format

### Critical: Scenario Formatting

**CORRECT** (use #### headers):
```markdown
#### Scenario: User login success
- **WHEN** valid credentials provided
- **THEN** return JWT token
```

**WRONG** (don't use bullets or bold):
```markdown
- **Scenario: User login**  ❌
**Scenario**: User login     ❌
### Scenario: User login      ❌
```

Every requirement MUST have at least one scenario.

### Requirement Wording
- Use SHALL/MUST for normative requirements (avoid should/may unless intentionally non-normative)

### Delta Operations

- `## ADDED Requirements` - New capabilities
- `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changed behavior
- `## REMOVED Requirements` - Deprecated features
- `## RENAMED Requirements` - Name changes

Headers matched with `trim(header)` - whitespace ignored.

#### When to use ADDED vs MODIFIED
- ADDED: Introduces a new capability or sub-capability that can stand alone as a requirement. Prefer ADDED when the change is orthogonal (e.g., adding "Slash Command Configuration") rather than altering the semantics of an existing requirement.
- MODIFIED: Changes the behavior, scope, or acceptance criteria of an existing requirement. Always paste the full, updated requirement content (header + all scenarios). The archiver will replace the entire requirement with what you provide here; partial deltas will drop previous details.
- RENAMED: Use when only the name changes. If you also change behavior, use RENAMED (name) plus MODIFIED (content) referencing the new name.

Common pitfall: Using MODIFIED to add a new concern without including the previous text. This causes loss of detail at archive time. If you aren’t explicitly changing the existing requirement, add a new requirement under ADDED instead.

Authoring a MODIFIED requirement correctly:
1) Locate the existing requirement in `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`.
2) Copy the entire requirement block (from `### Requirement: ...` through its scenarios).
3) Paste it under `## MODIFIED Requirements` and edit to reflect the new behavior.
4) Ensure the header text matches exactly (whitespace-insensitive) and keep at least one `#### Scenario:`.

Example for RENAMED:
```markdown
## RENAMED Requirements
- FROM: `### Requirement: Login`
- TO: `### Requirement: User Authentication`
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**"Change must have at least one delta"**
- Check `changes/[name]/specs/` exists with .md files
- Verify files have operation prefixes (## ADDED Requirements)

**"Requirement must have at least one scenario"**
- Check scenarios use `#### Scenario:` format (4 hashtags)
- Don't use bullet points or bold for scenario headers

**Silent scenario parsing failures**
- Exact format required: `#### Scenario: Name`
- Debug with: `openspec show [change] --json --deltas-only`

### Validation Tips

```bash
# Always use strict mode for comprehensive checks
openspec validate [change] --strict --no-interactive

# Debug delta parsing
openspec show [change] --json | jq '.deltas'

# Check specific requirement
openspec show [spec] --json -r 1
```

## Happy Path Script

```bash
# 1) Explore current state
openspec spec list --long
openspec list
# Optional full-text search:
# rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" openspec/specs
# rg -n "^#|Requirement:" openspec/changes

# 2) Choose change id and scaffold
CHANGE=add-two-factor-auth
mkdir -p openspec/changes/$CHANGE/{specs/auth}
printf "## Why\n...\n\n## What Changes\n- ...\n\n## Impact\n- ...\n" > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/proposal.md
printf "## 1.0 Implement OTP verification\n- [ ] 1.1 Add OTP input to login flow\n- [ ] 1.2 Implement OTP validation logic\n- [ ] 1.3 Add tests for OTP scenarios\n- [ ] 1.4 Verify tests pass\n" > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/tasks.md

# 3) Add deltas (example)
cat > openspec/changes/$CHANGE/specs/auth/spec.md << 'EOF'
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Two-Factor Authentication
Users MUST provide a second factor during login.

#### Scenario: OTP required
- **WHEN** valid credentials are provided
- **THEN** an OTP challenge is required
EOF

# 4) Validate
openspec validate $CHANGE --strict --no-interactive
```

## Multi-Capability Example

```
openspec/changes/add-2fa-notify/
├── proposal.md
├── tasks.md
└── specs/
    ├── auth/
    │   └── spec.md   # ADDED: Two-Factor Authentication
    └── notifications/
        └── spec.md   # ADDED: OTP email notification
```

auth/spec.md
```markdown
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Two-Factor Authentication
...
```

notifications/spec.md
```markdown
## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: OTP Email Notification
...
```

## Best Practices

### Simplicity First
- Default to <100 lines of new code
- Single-file implementations until proven insufficient
- Avoid frameworks without clear justification
- Choose boring, proven patterns

### Complexity Triggers
Only add complexity with:
- Performance data showing current solution too slow
- Concrete scale requirements (>1000 users, >100MB data)
- Multiple proven use cases requiring abstraction

### Clear References
- Use `file.ts:42` format for code locations
- Reference specs as `specs/auth/spec.md`
- Link related changes and PRs

### Capability Naming
- Use verb-noun: `user-auth`, `payment-capture`
- Single purpose per capability
- 10-minute understandability rule
- Split if description needs "AND"

### Change ID Naming
- Use kebab-case, short and descriptive: `add-two-factor-auth`
- Prefer verb-led prefixes: `add-`, `update-`, `remove-`, `refactor-`
- Ensure uniqueness; if taken, append `-2`, `-3`, etc.

## Error Recovery

### Change Conflicts
1. Run `openspec list` to see active changes
2. Check for overlapping specs
3. Coordinate with change owners
4. Consider combining proposals

### Validation Failures
1. Run with `--strict` flag
2. Check JSON output for details
3. Verify spec file format
4. Ensure scenarios properly formatted

### Missing Context
1. Read project.md first
2. Check related specs
3. Review recent archives
4. Ask for clarification

## Quick Reference

### Stage Indicators
- `changes/` - Proposed, not yet built
- `specs/` - Built and deployed
- `archive/` - Completed changes

### File Purposes
- `proposal.md` - Why and what
- `design.md` - Technical implementation plan (how to approach)
- `tasks.md` - Implementation checklist (what to do)
- `spec.md` - Requirements and behavior

### CLI Essentials
```bash
openspec list              # What's in progress?
openspec show [item]       # View details
openspec validate --strict --no-interactive  # Is it correct?
openspec archive <change-id> [--yes|-y]  # Mark complete (add --yes for automation)
```

Remember: Specs are truth. Changes are proposals. Keep them in sync.
